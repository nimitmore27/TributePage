            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha Empire in western India. He is considered to
                be one of the greatest warriors of his time and even today, stories of his exploits are narrated as a
                part of the folklore. With his valor and great administrative skills, Shivaji Maharaj carved out an
                enclave from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur. It eventually became the genesis of the
                Maratha Empire. After establishing his rule, Shivaji Maharaj implemented a competent and progressive
                administration with the help of a disciplined military and well-established administrative set-up.
                Shivaji Maharaj is well-known for his innovative military tactics that centered around non-conventional
                methods leveraging strategic factors like geography, speed, and surprise to defeat his more powerful
                enemies.
